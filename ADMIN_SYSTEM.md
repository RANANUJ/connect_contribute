# Admin System Implementation

## Overview
The admin system has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### 1. Updated Signup Flow
- ✅ Removed position selection for NGO members
- ✅ Replaced NGO dropdown with NGO name and code input fields
- ✅ All NGO signups now create members with default "member" position
- ✅ Added NGO code verification system

### 2. Admin Dashboard
- ✅ Hardcoded admin login: `rana1452005@gmail.co` / `anuj#123`
- ✅ Three-tab interface: NGOs, Members, Pending
- ✅ NGO management: Create, Edit, Delete NGOs
- ✅ Member verification: Approve/Reject pending members
- ✅ Auto-generated NGO codes for admin-created NGOs

### 3. Data Models
- ✅ Enhanced NGOMemberModel with `ngoName`, `ngoCode`, `isVerified` fields
- ✅ Updated NGOModel with `ngoCode` field and admin-friendly structure
- ✅ Updated FirestoreService with admin dashboard methods

### 4. Access Methods
- **Login Screen**: Use admin credentials on the main login screen
- **Email**: `rana1452005@gmail.com`
- **Password**: `anuj#123`
- **Behavior**: Admin credentials automatically redirect to admin dashboard

## How It Works

### For NGO Members:
1. User selects "NGO" during signup
2. Enters NGO name and NGO code (provided by admin)
3. Account is created but marked as `isVerified: false`
4. Member appears in admin dashboard "Pending" tab
5. Admin verifies the NGO code and approves/rejects the member

### For Admins:
1. Use admin credentials on the main login screen
2. Login with `rana1452005@gmail.com` / `anuj#123`
3. Automatically redirected to admin dashboard
4. Create NGOs with auto-generated codes
5. Manage NGO information
6. Verify pending members by checking NGO codes
7. Delete invalid or spam registrations
