## 📱 **App Package Verification**

Your current app package details:
```
Package Name: com.example.connect_contribute
Application ID: com.example.connect_contribute
Debug SHA-1: E1:C4:DC:6C:C3:D1:C9:16:42:D5:0C:65:C3:4A:52:F4:DF:9E:00:8E
```

**Make sure these match exactly in Firebase Console!**

## 🔧 **Rate Limiting Solution**

The error `too-many-requests` means you've hit Firebase's rate limit:

### **Immediate Solutions:**
1. **Wait 1-2 hours** before trying again
2. **Use test phone numbers** in Firebase Console
3. **Try from a different device/network**

### **Prevention:**
- Don't test too frequently (max 5-10 times per hour)
- Use Firebase test numbers for development
- Implement proper cooldown in your app (already done)

---

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **After Firebase Console Setup:**

1. **Download new `google-services.json`:**
   - Go to Project Settings → General → Your apps
   - Download the updated `google-services.json`
   - Replace the file in: `android/app/google-services.json`

2. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

3. **Test OTP with debug numbers:**
   - Use the test numbers you added in Firebase Console
   - Check console logs for detailed error messages

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

After completing these steps:
1. **SHA-1 errors will disappear**
2. **reCAPTCHA will work properly**
3. **OTP will be sent successfully**
4. **Phone verification will complete**

## 📞 **Support Info**

If you continue having issues:
1. **Check Firebase Console logs**
